Preface: Not a clue what I'm doing here but it somewhat works:tm:

# Building
I've only built this on a Debian system, which required the following apt packages from mainstream package sources:-

```sh
clang libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev pkg-config libavdevice-dev libpulse-dev libpulse0 pulseaudio
```
